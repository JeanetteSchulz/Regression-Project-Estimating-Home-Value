Ideally, if you talk about trying more algorithms to improve performance, think about why you need to improve performance. And if the business calls for it, remember the best way to improve performance is to have better predictors/features. If you talk about gathering more data, being specific about what data you think will help you understand the problem better and why is the way to go!\n",
